This project provides a solid foundation for automated receipt processing. Here are some ideas for future enhancements to make it even more robust and feature-rich:


# 1.Advanced Data Extraction with Textract AnalyzeExpense:
Currently, detect_document_text is used. Textract also offers AnalyzeExpense, which is specifically designed for receipts and invoices. It automatically extracts structured data like vendor name, total, line items, and taxes as key-value pairs, which would significantly improve extraction accuracy and detail.

# 2.Output to S3 for Data Lake Integration:
Instead of just email, save a structured JSON or Parquet file of the extracted data to another S3 bucket. This creates a "data lake" layer, enabling further analytics.

# 3.Cost Categorization using Machine Learning (e.g., Amazon Comprehend):
Use Amazon Comprehend (or a custom ML model) to automatically categorize expenses (e.g., "Groceries", "Travel", "Utilities") based on the extracted text or vendor name. This data could then be stored in DynamoDB.

# 4.Receipt Archiving:
After successful processing, move the original receipt image from the incoming/ folder to an archive/ folder within the S3 bucket to keep the incoming/ folder clean.

# 5.Duplicate Detection:
Implement logic to check for duplicate receipts based on total amount, date, and vendor name to avoid reprocessing the same receipt multiple times.
